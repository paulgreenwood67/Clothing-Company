              <h3>CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF INNOVATION</h3>

          <div className="aboutText">
          <p>Dedicated and contemporary, durable and comprehensive, British streetwear brand Duck and Cover is celebrating its 20th Anniversary this season. Founded in 1996, the brand is known for their fresh and forward-thinking approach to menswear. Blending utility-inspired textiles and details with sportswear influences long before the word ‘athleisure’ was invented. For Autumn/Winter ’16 Duck and Cover has, as ever, chosen to look forwards and not back, celebrating the start of their 3rd decade in business with a collection that feels thoroughly modern and relevant for the man on the street today.
            Divided into 3 key stories, the AW16 collection explores an obsession for utility and function with a strong sport subculture influence, and reflects the brand’s design principles over the last 20 years.</p>
  
            <h5>Sport utility</h5>
            <p>Inspired by technical materials and finished with workwear detailing, sport and utility are inextricably woven into Duck and Cover’s DNA. For this season, this means ‘oilcloth’ influenced outerwear, heavily-textured knitwear and technical jackets finished with functional zips and signature pocket detailing. The colour palette of marine blues and military greens with accents of emergency red and orange underlines this active feel, while a unique ‘glitch’ camouflage provides a motif.</p>
            
            <h5>Street subculture</h5>
            <p>Continuing Duck and Cover’s legacy of sportswear influences, this story blends the brand’s origins in the heart of the nineties’ cultural explosion with a truly modern, clean approach to detailing. Bright blues and geometric pattern flashes give the monochrome story strong street-inspired punctuation, while key styles such as the five-in-one jacket and duffle coat are reimagined in technical fabrics that are ideal for the terrace casuals look.</p>
            
            <h5>Contemporary classics</h5>
            <p>Every season, Duck and Cover rework and reinvent the wardrobe staples that men wear on a daily basis. Classic navy, mid-blue and off-white jersey pieces are subtly accented with yellows and reds, while casual gingham shirting, tipped polos and cotton knitwear are all designed to slot seamlessly into any guy’s wardrobe. Denim jeans are available in 5 different cuts and a wide array of washes and finishes.</p>
